**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. You will only be provided with one tenant for the practice labs in this
course. The settings and actions you take within this tenant do not roll-back or
reset, whereas the virtual machine you are provided with does reset each time
you close the lab session. Please be aware that Dynamics 365 is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual Dynamics 365 tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.
