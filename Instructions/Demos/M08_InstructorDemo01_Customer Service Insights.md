**MB-230: Customer Service Insights**

**Instructor Demo 1**

In this instructor led demo, you will be walking students through setting up and
working with Customer Service Insights. Because Customer Service Insights
typically requires additional licensing, students will not be able to get the
full Customer Service Insights on their own. This demo will provide them the
opportunity to see Customer Service Insights in action. You need to ensure that
you have a Customer Insights Subscription to show this information

There is a pre-recorded click through demo that you can use during actual class
room presentation, but it is highly recommended that you still walk through the
demo to make sure that everything is configured for the environment that you are
teaching out of at that time.

**Before Class Begins**

You should verify that Customer Service Insights is installed and attached to
the Dynamics 365 Customer Service environment that you are working with. You can
do that by navigating to <https://CSI.ai.dynamics.com> and verifying that the
sample work space is there. That is all you need to do with the environment at
this point.

**Task 1: Create a Customer Service Insights workspace.**

1.  Open an in-private browser and navigate to
    <https://CSI.ai.dynamics.com>**.** *(If prompted for credentials, use the
    same credentials that you have been using for the training environment)*

2.  Using the Navigation at the top of the application, select the
    **Workspaces** icon. From the list of available environments, select add
    workspace.

3.  In the **Connect your data** screen, select **Dynamics 365.**

4.  From the available list of environments, select the environment that
    contains the case related data that you want to attach to.

5.  When the **Map your data** screen appears, click the **Get Started** button.

6.  In the **Find case records** screen, ensure that **Case** is selected and
    click **Next**.

7.  In the **Map case records** screen, all the **Destination** fields should be
    automatically mapped to the appropriate **Source** fields. *(If not, map
    each Destination field to the Source Field that matches the Destination
    field name exactly.)* Once complete, click the **Save** button.

8.  The application will examine your cases and begin to create a workspace with
    topics. Once completed you will be taken to your new workspace.

    **IMPORTANT:** *It can take awhile to populate all the data in your
    workspace. While that is taking place, we will have you work with a sample
    environment to walk through navigating through the application.*

**Task 2: Take students on a tour of Customer Service Insights**

In this demo you will be walking students through the navigation user interface
of the customer service insights application. During the tour, call out specific
items that they should be aware of, in addition to how the different elements
might impact what they are doing in the application.

1.  In you are not already in **Customer Service Insights**, navigate to
    <https://CSI.ai.dynamics.com>

2.  Using the **Navigation** at the top of the application, select the
    Workspaces icon. From the list of available environments, select sample
    environment.

3.  After the sample environment loads, select the **Home** screen if necessary.
    This is the main screen that provides key organizational details for them.
    Call out to the students that you can filter the results that are being
    displayed to show over the last **24 Hours**, **7** or **30 days**.

4.  Each area will contain a light bulb that will provide the use with details
    as to why that information is important. Next to **Topics impacting
    resolution time**, select the **light bulb icon**. The why this matted fly
    out will open that contains details why the data matters and any related
    recommendations. *(This helps better use that information to drive
    decisions.)*

5.  Under **Topics to watch**, select the topic that is listed as the **\#1
    topic to watch** *(Likely User needs help with payments.)* Before selecting
    call out the relevant details such as the number of cases associated with it
    as well as the drivers.

6.  You can dive into the details related to a topic by selecting the filters at
    the top of the screen. Click the **Channel** dropdown and select **Phone**
    to filter the details for only items coming from the Phone Channel.

7.  Click the **Product** drop down and select **Contoso Nutrition**. Call out
    to students how the data is further filtered to reflect Contoso Nutrition.

8.  Remove the product filter by hovering your mouse next to the product drop
    down and selecting the **eraser** icon.

9.  Each Customer Service Insights visual such as lists and charts will have
    different slicers that impact how the data is presented. Click on the
    **filter** icon to display the list of filters that are impacting the
    results of that visual.

10. Hover over and select the **ellipsis** to provide a list of options that can
    be done such as modifying the sorting and exporting data. From the list that
    appears, select the **spotlight** icon. The application will spotlight the
    visual that you are currently working with.

11. Click the **ellipsis** and select the **spotlight** again to remove the
    spotlight from the view.

12. Locate and select **Cases** at the top of the Topic page to display the
    actual the cases that are behind the analytics.

13. Click in the **search** field and enter the text **User canâ€™t**. Notice how
    each of the cases that contain that text are displayed. Hover over one of
    the cases show the **thumbs up** and **thumbs down** icons. These are used
    to indicate whether the case was correctly placed in the right topic.

14. Select **KPI summary** from the left navigation. Call attention to the
    filter list at the top. Notice that the **Channel** filter we applied
    earlier is still applied. Use the **eraser** icon to remove the Channel
    filter.

15. In the middle of the KPI Summary screen, there is a visual that shows **Case
    Breakdown**, **Case Priority**, and **Case Channel** details. In that
    visual, locate the **Web** column under **Case Channel** stacked column
    chart. Use your mouse to hover over the totals for each color.

16. Select the Web bar with the **Status** of **active**. Notice how the rest
    screen changes based on the new filter details. Click the web active bar
    again to remove the filter and display all the data.
